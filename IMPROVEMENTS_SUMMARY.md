# YAML Front Matter Improvements - Implementation Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-19

## Problem Addressed

An AI agent reported that the `zotero_ensure_yaml_citations` tool failed with `No module named 'yaml'`. This indicated the tool was running in an environment without PyYAML installed, though the feature itself existed in the codebase.

## Root Cause

The issue was environmental, not a missing feature:
- The MCP server already had YAML front matter functionality
- PyYAML was declared as a dependency in `pyproject.toml`
- The error likely came from running an older build or a non-Docker environment

## Improvements Implemented

### 1. Enhanced `ensure_yaml_citations` Function

**File:** `src/zotero_mcp/__init__.py`

**Changes:**
- Tries multiple YAML parsers in order: PyYAML → ruamel.yaml → text fallback
- Handles BOM (Byte Order Mark) via `encoding="utf-8-sig"`
- Normalizes line endings (CRLF → LF) for cross-platform compatibility
- Returns parser name in message: `"YAML citations updated (parser=pyyaml)."`
- Logs which parser was used for troubleshooting

**Benefits:**
- Works in any environment, even without YAML libraries
- Clear feedback about which parser was used
- More robust edge-case handling

### 2. Enhanced `zotero_health` Diagnostics

**File:** `src/zotero_mcp/__init__.py`

**Changes:**
- Reports `pyyaml: ok|missing`
- Reports `ruamel: ok|missing`
- Predicts `yamlParser: pyyaml|ruamel|text` (which parser ensure_yaml_citations will use)

**Example output:**
```json
{
  "pyyaml": "ok",
  "ruamel": "ok",
  "yamlParser": "pyyaml",
  "zoteroClient": "ok",
  "timeout": "(default)",
  "cacheTTL": "(default)",
  "cacheMax": "(default)",
  "rateMinInterval": "(default)",
  "logLevel": "INFO",
  "now": "2025-10-18T22:18:16Z",
  "latencyMs": 124.4
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Users can immediately see which YAML libraries are available
- Clear indication of fallback behavior
- Easier troubleshooting

### 3. Comprehensive Test Coverage

**File:** `tests/test_bibliography.py`

**New tests added:**
- `test_ensure_yaml_citations_idempotency` - Running twice produces identical results
- `test_ensure_yaml_citations_update_existing` - Updates existing front matter while preserving other keys
- `test_ensure_yaml_citations_crlf` - Handles Windows line endings
- `test_ensure_yaml_citations_with_bom` - Handles UTF-8 BOM
- `test_ensure_yaml_citations_text_fallback` - Verifies fallback works

**Test results:** 48/48 passing ✓

### 4. Docker Redeploy Helper

**File:** `Makefile`

**New target added:**
```makefile
docker-redeploy:
    # Builds image, stops old container, starts new one
    # Shows logs to verify startup
```

**Usage:**
```bash
make docker-redeploy
```

**Benefits:**
- One command for complete rebuild/redeploy
- Reduces chance of user error
- Shows verification steps automatically

### 5. Documentation Updates

**File:** `README.md`

**Sections added:**

1. **YAML Front Matter for Citations**
   - Example minimal YAML block
   - How the parser selection works
   - Manual fallback instructions

2. **Troubleshooting**
   - How to check YAML parser status via `zotero_health`
   - What to do if `yamlParser: text` is shown
   - Docker redeploy instructions

**Benefits:**
- Users understand what YAML front matter is needed
- Clear troubleshooting path for parser issues
- Documented redeploy workflow

## Verification

All changes verified:

✓ **Tests:** 48/48 passing (pytest)  
✓ **Build:** No errors  
✓ **Health check:** Returns enhanced diagnostics  
✓ **Parser detection:** Shows `pyyaml: ok`, `ruamel: ok`, `yamlParser: pyyaml`

## Next Steps for Users

1. **Immediate fix:** Run `make docker-redeploy` to deploy the improved version
2. **Verify:** Call `zotero_health` tool to see enhanced diagnostics
3. **Use:** Call `zotero_ensure_yaml_citations` - it will now report which parser it used

## Files Changed

- `src/zotero_mcp/__init__.py` - Enhanced ensure_yaml_citations and zotero_health
- `tests/test_bibliography.py` - Added 5 new tests for edge cases
- `Makefile` - Added docker-redeploy target
- `README.md` - Added YAML documentation and troubleshooting
- `plan4.md` - Original improvement plan (reference)
- `IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## Key Takeaway

**The feature was never missing** - it just needed better diagnostics, documentation, and environmental robustness. The improvements ensure users get clear feedback about what's happening and can troubleshoot any environment issues easily.
